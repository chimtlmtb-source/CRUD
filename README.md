# CRUD Basic User API

## Project Overview

The **CRUD Basic User API** is a simple backend application built with **Node.js** and **Express**, designed to help beginners understand how to build a **RESTful API** with basic **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations for user management.

This project does **not use any database** — all data is stored temporarily in memory (**RAM**), making it easy to learn, experiment, and test.  
You can test all API endpoints using **Postman** or **Thunder Client** in **Visual Studio Code**.

## ⚙️ Project Objectives

- Get familiar with the **Node.js** runtime and **npm** package manager.
- Learn to install and manage Node versions using **nvm (Node Version Manager)**.
- Build a basic REST API using the **Express.js** framework.
- Configure a professional project setup with **ESLint**, **Prettier**, and a detailed **README.md**.
- Learn how to start and test your API using **npm scripts** and **Postman**.
